# TODOs
A list of feature ideas and bugs to work on to further develop the app
## Feature Ideas 💡 & Improvements 🌈
- Add an resize observer listener for mobile to adjust the video player size accordingly.
- Add the start and end time selected above or below the link in the timeline controls
- Add some styling for the loop link, maybe the pulse animation from tailwindcss? or a fun infinity symbol icon that animates while looping
- Add an additional timeline or markers to the current timeline to indicate in and out points
- Add an option for increasing video size on desktop browser sizes
- Finish error handling, it isn't great at the moment...
